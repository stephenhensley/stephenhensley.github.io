<h1 id="home">Nebulae Instrument Tester</h1>
<p>The instrument tester was originally built in python, using ctcsound and TKinter. I figured it would be cool if it could be web based instead.</p>
<p>I'll update this soon with some content, but for now I just need a place to redirect from home</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="waaw/index.html">Web Audio Audio Worklet Examples - by Victor Lazzarini</a>: These examples were taken to test running csound on the web within my github.io page. I may end up modifying them to test some ideas.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="instr_tester/index.html">Nebulae Instr Tester - Web Version</a>: After experiencing some issues packaging the python implementation for cross platform behavior, I thought I would investigate rebuilding the tester in Javascript to run in the browser.</p></li>
</ul>
