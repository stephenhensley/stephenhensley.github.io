I'll be using this space as a testing grounds for web application ideas, and possibly a blog.

- [Web Audio Audio Worklet Examples - by Victor Lazzarini](waaw/index.html): These examples were taken to test running csound on the web within my github.io page. I may end up modifying them to test some ideas.)
- [Nebulae Instr Tester - Web Version](instr_tester/index.html) After experiencing some issues packaging the python implementation for cross platform behavior, I thought I would investigate rebuilding the tester in Javascript to run in the browser.
