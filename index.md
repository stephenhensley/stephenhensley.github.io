I'll be using this space as a testing grounds for web application ideas, and possibly a blog.</p>

- [waaw/index.html](Web Audio Audio Worklet Examples - by Victor Lazzarini</a>: These examples were taken to test running csound on the web within my github.io page. I may end up modifying them to test some ideas.)
- [instr_tester/index.html](Nebulae Instr Tester - Web Version</a>: After experiencing some issues packaging the python implementation for cross platform behavior, I thought I would investigate rebuilding the tester in Javascript to run in the browser.)
